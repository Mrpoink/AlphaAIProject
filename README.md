# AlphaAIProject
This an AI project built off Google's Gemini Generative Language Model
THIS MODEL CANNOT RUN ON x32 CPUS, TRUST ME I TRIED
Please keep in mind this is NOT a comprehensive guide to installation or usage, although I will provide links to guides I follow, and so can you if you wish to build this project for yourself.
This particular application of Gemini was designed to be ran in the Linux terminal via a python virtual environment. 
It was created to be a tool that can be used almost instantaneously to do anything Gemini can do but in a more customizable way so users can do anything they want with it within the parameters Google
has given us. 

Installation - https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/quickstart (Google's Python Quickstart Guide)/n
***(I will try to make a bash file to install all this stuff)***

Create API Key from Google (use google's website stuff)

sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3-ven

pip install -U google-generativeai

***(If you cannot get AlphaAI to work on your machine then you might need to make a venv and build the packages and dependencies yourself and copy over the python files I've created)***
